- **Local Culture**: "Everyone is something in LKO Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. What is the obsession peeps."

- **Justice/Fairness**: "I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go. He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly."
